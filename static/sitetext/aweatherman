<p>"the idea for recording a first set of songs and music came straight from billy saying that i should, i dunno man it was more a case of why not, never tried that before. it's like trying to bite your own teeth init, kind of within grasp but also west."</p>

<p>"any kind of background would i guess come from american style music, stuff that really evolved from the most basic rhythms, but also those kinds of fundamental musics informed and influenced so much stuff that seems so far removed. but i think there's a basic underlying thing to all of it, like it presents itself in different ways but i just love that simple kind of music. for a basis at least anyway, so much and so many different things spring off from that initial base, but that's what it is at the centre. i just think that kinds of rhythms and beats have just been so accessible, you can dress it up in different ways but it's the same kind of stuff."</p>

<p>"i dunno i think this also came at a pretty west time, like having to actually think and do rather than just coast in terms of what i was doing. nothing's really been easy, but i'm not so used to having to consider things so much, and this has been a useful part of just figuring stuff out, treading water essentially. i used to love my time in wolverhampton but in several ways felt like i wasn't enjoying the brief periods of time where i was here. i wasn't anticipating to have such a mad and normal and fine and enjoyable time, just treading water, but this has brought something to my experience that i wasn't expecting or can place any kind of abstract value to,<br>
